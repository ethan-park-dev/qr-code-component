## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

---

### What I learned

This project helped reinforce key CSS concepts such as:

- **Flexbox for Layout**:
  Using `display: flex` to align the content centrally on the page:

  ```css
  body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
  }
  ```

- **CSS Variables for Consistency**:
  Declaring and using custom properties to manage colors and spacing:

  ```css
  :root {
    --slate-900: #1f314f;
    --slate-500: #687781;
    --slate-300: #d5e1ef;
    --spacing-200: 16px;
  }
  ```

- **Reusable Components**:
  Breaking the structure into reusable, predictable elements like `.card` and `.text-container`.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to focus on:

- Improving responsiveness for more devices.
- Experimenting with additional styling frameworks like Tailwind CSS or SCSS.
- Enhancing accessibility features like ARIA attributes to make the component more inclusive.
